# Welcome to DREAM CANTEEN

<p align="center"><img src="readme/title-screen.png" /></p>

Dream Canteen is a kitchen action game where you can use amazing abilities to make your cooking more efficient.

At present everything is accessible within the level and all you need to do is to finish as many orders as you can within the limited time.

Still working on it, we are sure there will be more interesting mechanics in the game.

Don't hesitate to contact our game designer with any questions or suggestions.

Hope you have fun!
